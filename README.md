# Slim 3 Authentication
Coming Soon...  

A fully featured Slim 3 authentication system (probably the easiest to work with too!).  

This is the full authentication system from my DemoApp repo and it includes many improvements and fixes.  

This work is licensed under a MIT License, see LICENSE file.  

Feel free to use this authentication system with your project!  

I will add a "Getting Started" guide soon to show you how you can implement your own pages and controllers, soon.  

If you have any feature requests, go to the issue page: [#1](https://github.com/savageboy74/slim-3-authentication/issues/1)
