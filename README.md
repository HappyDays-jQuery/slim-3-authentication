# Slim 3 Authentication v2
v2 is not compatible with v1 meaning pretty much everything has changed.  

This version will have a few more features and will be more configurable to fit your project.  

My plans for this version are as follows:  

- Account activation can be changed from: none, mail or recaptcha
    - None means all accounts will be active upon registration.
    - Mail will use MailTrap for development and MailGun for production.
    - reCAPTCHA means users will need to complete Google's "No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA" when registering
- I plan on trying to localize strings from alerts to message subjects using the config system.

##### There will be more plans coming soon.  

You will be able to view a demo soon at [https://demo.savagedev.io](https://demo.savagedev.io)
